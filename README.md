# Anti-Rush-Taze
This a feature I made to detect and prevent "rush tazing" in GTA SA:MP Roleplay Servers

#### yes I know it's a ton of comments
I wrote this code back in 2014. This code is just a snippet concept I wrote to apply for development roles. I thought commenting everything would show that I actually know what each line does, hey... it worked. =)

Introduction:
This idea has been something on my mind for quite a long time. Now I am finally going to make my first attempt to get this idea moving. I know this will be a huge idea and a huge possible change to the game, but this is only one step in my many ideas in making this server better. Someone has to speak up and I am willing to do so.

Explanation:
In explanation, the idea is quite simple.
Remove the Rush Taze Policy, replace it with script.

Idea:
The rush taze policy will be removed and replaced with a script that does the followingâ€¦
LEO/LEA can NOT draw their tazer after taking damage. (for 10-15 seconds)

If the LEO/LEA has their tazer drawn and takes damage, it will automatically be holstered.

If the LEO/LEA fires their tazer at a player that is shooting,(or was shooting within the last 5-8 seconds) the player will not be tazed.

Script:
Is this possible through script? Yes it is. As a knowledgeable scripter myself, experienced in many different languages I can tell you, it is very possible. I will also provide an example I scripted and tested on local server. It only took me about 20-30 minutes to script this. It is a very easy update to do.
